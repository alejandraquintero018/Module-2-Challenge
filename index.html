        <h2> Get to Know Me </h2>
        <p> Hi, my name is Alejandra Quintero, I am a budding developer excited to apply the skills that I gained in the UCLA extention Coding Bootcamp. In the past, I have led various renovation and capital improvement projects and designed custom organizational systems using Notion to efficiently complete projects within Real Estate. 
            I have a strong background in Chemistry, with a bachelors in Chemistry and research experience in quantitative method development and analysis of plant-produced metabolites using GC MS/MS. I have worked as an Analytical Chemist testing for safety in medicinal products.
            
            I am productivity nerd, always exploring the most efficient ways to learn, and get things done. I have a passion for plant-based cooking and enjoy spending time remaking my favorite classics with whole foods plant based ingredients.
